### Hi, I'm Jakl
Or Janno, the Media and Computing student you trust.  
I use my freetime to work on [multiple Minecraft-Plugins](https://github.com/Jakllp) and have now started to work on a [YouTube-Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc94trx9C8v2U1StuyR_0Dw) more actively.  
With these videos, my repositories and this blog I'm trying to provide tutorials, reviews etc. as I'm often searching for good coverage/documentation myself.  

The rest of my own time is spend raging in CS:GO or screaming at/with my friends in other games.  
I'm basically the average wannabe YouTuber.
